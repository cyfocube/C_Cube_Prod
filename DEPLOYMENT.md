npm install --save-dev gh-pages

# Add to package.json scripts:
"deploy": "gh-pages -d build"

# Build and deploy
npm run build-web
npm run deploy
```

### 4. Firebase Hosting

Google's Firebase offers fast, secure hosting.

#### Setup
```bash
# Install Firebase CLI
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Login and initialize
firebase login
firebase init hosting

# Configure firebase.json:
{
  "hosting": {
    "public": "build",
    "ignore": ["firebase.json", "**/.*", "**/node_modules/**"],
    "rewrites": [
      {
        "source": "**",
        "destination": "/index.html"
      }
    ]
  }
}

# Build and deploy
npm run build-web
firebase deploy
```

### 5. Heroku

Deploy to Heroku with a simple Node.js server.

#### Setup
1. Create `server.js` in project root:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const path = require('path');
const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'build')));

app.get('*', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, 'build', 'index.html'));
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
});
```

2. Add to `package.json`:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "heroku-postbuild": "npm run build-web",
    "start": "node server.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.2"
  }
}
```

3. Deploy:
```bash
# Install Heroku CLI and login
heroku create your-app-name
git push heroku main
```

### 6. AWS S3 + CloudFront

Enterprise-grade hosting with AWS.

#### Setup
1. Create S3 bucket with static website hosting
2. Upload build files to S3
3. Configure CloudFront distribution
4. Set up Route 53 for custom domain (optional)

```bash
# Using AWS CLI
aws s3 sync build/ s3://your-bucket-name --delete
aws cloudfront create-invalidation --distribution-id YOUR_DISTRIBUTION_ID --paths "/*"
```

## Environment Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create `.env.production` for production-specific settings:
```
REACT_APP_NODE_ENV=production
REACT_APP_VERSION=1.0.0
GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false
```

### Custom Domain Setup
1. **DNS Configuration**: Point your domain to the hosting platform
2. **HTTPS**: Ensure SSL certificate is configured
3. **Security Headers**: Configure security headers (included in netlify.toml and vercel.json)

## Post-Deployment Checklist

1. âœ… Test the live application thoroughly
2. âœ… Verify all pages load correctly
3. âœ… Test wallet creation and operations
4. âœ… Confirm educational disclaimers are visible
5. âœ… Test on different browsers and devices
6. âœ… Verify HTTPS is working
7. âœ… Test performance with browser dev tools
8. âœ… Confirm analytics/monitoring (if implemented)

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Analytics
Consider adding analytics to track usage:
- Google Analytics
- Plausible Analytics (privacy-focused)
- Fathom Analytics

### Error Monitoring
- Sentry for error tracking
- LogRocket for session replay
- Bugsnag for error monitoring

### Performance Monitoring
- Lighthouse CI for automated auditing
- Web Vitals monitoring
- CDN performance tracking

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Build Failures
```bash
# Clear cache and rebuild
npm run clean  # If available
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run build-web
```

#### Routing Issues
- Ensure your hosting platform redirects all routes to index.html
- Check that the `_redirects` file (Netlify) or `vercel.json` is configured correctly

#### Environment Variables Not Working
- Prefix React environment variables with `REACT_APP_`
- Check that variables are defined in the hosting platform's settings

#### HTTPS Mixed Content
- Ensure all external resources use HTTPS
- Check that API calls are made to HTTPS endpoints

### Performance Optimization

#### Bundle Size Optimization
```bash
# Analyze bundle size
npm install --save-dev webpack-bundle-analyzer
npm run build-web
npx webpack-bundle-analyzer build/static/js/*.js
```

#### Image Optimization
- Use WebP format for better compression
- Implement lazy loading for images
- Use responsive images with different sizes

#### Caching Strategy
- Configure proper cache headers
- Use service workers for offline functionality
- Implement bundle splitting for better caching

## Security Considerations

### Web-Specific Security
1. **Content Security Policy**: Configure CSP headers
2. **HTTPS Only**: Force HTTPS redirects
3. **Secure Headers**: Implement security headers
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies updated

### Educational Context
- Prominently display educational disclaimers
- Make it clear this is for learning only
- Provide links to production wallet recommendations
- Include security education resources
