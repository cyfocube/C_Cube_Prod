## Creating Your First Wallet

Alright, let's create your first wallet! This is like opening your first bank account, but way cooler because you're in complete control.

### The Wallet Creation Process

**Step 1: Understanding Wallet Types**

When you click "Setup New Wallet," you'll see options for different wallet types:

1. **Single Network Wallet**: Perfect for beginners
   - Tied to one specific blockchain (like Ethereum)
   - Simpler to manage
   - Great for learning the ropes

2. **Multi-Chain Wallet**: For the ambitious
   - Works across all supported networks
   - More advanced but more flexible
   - Ideal once you're comfortable with crypto

**My Recommendation**: Start with a single network wallet on Ethereum. You can always create more wallets later!

**Step 2: Password Protection (Highly Recommended)**

Here's where security gets serious. You'll see an option to password-protect your wallet:

- **Why use a password?** It encrypts your private key on your device
- **What happens if you forget it?** You'll need your backup phrase to recover
- **How strong should it be?** At least 8 characters with numbers and symbols

**Password Tips**:
- Use something memorable but not obvious
- Don't use your birthday, pet's name, or "password123"
- Consider using a password manager
- Write it down and store it safely offline

**Step 3: Your Wallet is Born!**

Once created, C-Cube will show you three critical pieces of information:

1. **Your Wallet Address**: Like your crypto email address (starts with 0x...)
2. **Your Private Key**: The secret that controls your funds (NEVER share this!)
3. **Your Recovery Phrase**: 12 words that can restore your wallet

### The Sacred Recovery Phrase

Let me be crystal clear about this: **Your recovery phrase is the master key to your cryptocurrency**. Here's what you absolutely must do:

**‚úÖ DO THIS:**
- Write it down on paper immediately
- Store it in a fireproof safe
- Make multiple copies in different locations
- Never store it digitally (no screenshots, no cloud storage)
- Test your backup by restoring it on a test device

**‚ùå NEVER DO THIS:**
- Share it with anyone (not even family, unless you trust them with your life savings)
- Store it on your computer or phone
- Take a photo of it
- Email it to yourself
- Store it in the cloud

**Real Talk**: People have lost millions of dollars by not properly securing their recovery phrase. Don't be one of them!
