1. **Your Tutorial Wallet Address**: Learn about crypto addresses (starts with 0x...)
2. **Your Educational Private Key**: Understand what controls funds (NEVER share real ones!)
3. **Your Learning Recovery Phrase**: Practice with 12 words that could restore a wallet

### The Educational Recovery Phrase Exercise

Let me be crystal clear about this educational exercise: **Understanding recovery phrases is crucial for real crypto safety**. Here's what you should practice:

**‚úÖ PRACTICE THIS:**
- Write down the tutorial phrase on paper
- Practice storing it in a secure location
- Make multiple practice copies
- Learn why digital storage is dangerous
