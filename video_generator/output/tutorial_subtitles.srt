Before we begin

it's important to understand

that cryptocurrency security is your responsibility

22
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,500
C-Cube provides the tools

23
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,000
but you must follow security best practices

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,500
Always backup your recovery phrases

25
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:40,500
in a secure location

26
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,500
These phrases are the only way

27
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,000
to recover your wallet

28
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,500
if your device is lost or damaged

29
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,500
Never share your private keys

30
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,500
or recovery phrases with anyone

31
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,500
Legitimate services will never ask

32
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,000

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000

34
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,500
and enable all available security features

35
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:15,500
