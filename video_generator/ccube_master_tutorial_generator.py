Layer 2 is Password Encryption - your private key is encrypted with your password, so even if someone accesses your computer, they can't use your wallet without the password. Stronger password equals stronger protection. Layer 3 is Transaction Signing - every transaction must be manually signed by you, so no transaction can happen without your explicit approval. Always verify the details before signing! Layer 4 is Network Verification - C-Cube verifies you're connecting to legitimate networks, preventing connection to malicious fake networks.

There are three types of transactions: Native Coin Transfers for sending ETH, MATIC, BNB which is the simplest type, Token Transfers for sending ERC-20 and BEP-20 tokens which requires token contract address but still pays gas fees in native coin, and Smart Contract Interactions for more complex transactions like interacting with DeFi protocols with custom data fields.

Recipient address safety follows the golden rule: Always verify recipient addresses! Use safe methods to get addresses like copying from the recipient's official wallet, using QR code scanning when available, selecting from your own wallets in C-Cube, or copying from verified exchange withdrawal pages.

If your recovery phrase isn't working, check word spelling and order carefully, ensure you're using the correct number of words, and verify you're restoring to the same wallet type. If your wallet isn't showing, check if you're on the correct network, verify wallet selection in the interface, and look for wallet in multi-chain view. For balance and display issues like 'My balance shows zero' or 'Tokens are missing,' diagnostic steps include network verification to confirm you're viewing the correct network, token addition by manually adding missing tokens using contract addresses, and synchronization issues by refreshing the wallet interface and checking internet connection. Stay calm - your funds are safe on the blockchain, verify you have correct recovery information, and try wallet restoration process.",
