C-Cube Cold Wallet - Getting Started Tutorial Script

Welcome to C-Cube Cold Wallet, your secure offline cryptocurrency storage solution.

This tutorial will guide you through creating your first wallet and understanding the key security principles that keep your cryptocurrency safe.

C-Cube is designed with security as the top priority. Your private keys are encrypted and stored only on your device, never transmitted online or stored on remote servers.

Key Features:
- Complete offline operation for maximum security
- Military-grade AES-256 encryption
- Support for multiple blockchain networks
- Open-source code for transparency and trust
- User-friendly interface for ease of use

Before we begin, it's important to understand that cryptocurrency security is your responsibility. C-Cube provides the tools, but you must follow security best practices.

Always backup your recovery phrases in a secure location. These phrases are the only way to recover your wallet if your device is lost or damaged.

Never share your private keys or recovery phrases with anyone. Legitimate services will never ask for this information.

Use strong, unique passwords and enable all available security features.

In the next steps, we'll walk through creating your first wallet, setting up security measures, and making your first transaction.

Remember to start with small amounts while you learn the system, then gradually increase as you become more comfortable.

Thank you for choosing C-Cube for your cryptocurrency security needs.

C-Cube Security Best Practices Script

Security is the foundation of cryptocurrency storage. This tutorial covers essential security practices for C-Cube users.

First Principle: Your Keys, Your Responsibility
C-Cube stores your private keys encrypted on your device only. We cannot access your funds or recover lost passwords. This design ensures maximum security but requires careful key management on your part.

Second Principle: Recovery Phrases Are Critical
Your recovery phrase is a series of words that can restore your entire wallet. Write it down on paper and store it in multiple secure locations. Never store it digitally or take photos of it.

Third Principle: Strong Passwords Matter
Use a strong, unique password for your C-Cube wallet. Include uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Never reuse passwords from other accounts.

Fourth Principle: Verify Everything
Always double-check recipient addresses and transaction amounts before confirming. Cryptocurrency transactions are irreversible once confirmed on the blockchain.

Fifth Principle: Start Small
When first using C-Cube, test with small amounts to ensure you understand the process. Gradually increase amounts as you become more confident.

Sixth Principle: Offline is Safer
For maximum security, use C-Cube on a computer that never connects to the internet. This eliminates the risk of online attacks entirely.

Seventh Principle: Regular Backups
Regularly verify that your recovery phrase backup is secure and accessible. Test recovery on a separate device if possible.

Eighth Principle: Stay Updated
Keep C-Cube updated to the latest version to ensure you have the latest security improvements and features.

Following these principles will help ensure your cryptocurrency remains safe and secure.

C-Cube Wallet Creation Walkthrough Script

Let's create your first C-Cube wallet step by step.

Step 1: Security Acknowledgment
When you first open C-Cube, you'll see a security acknowledgment. Read this carefully as it explains your responsibilities as a cryptocurrency user. Check the box to acknowledge that you understand the risks and responsibilities.

Step 2: Choose Network Type
Select whether you want a single-network wallet or multi-chain wallet. For beginners, we recommend starting with a single network like Ethereum or Bitcoin.

Step 3: Network Selection
Choose your specific blockchain network. Popular options include:
- Ethereum Mainnet for ETH and ERC-20 tokens
- Bitcoin for BTC transactions
- Other networks as needed

Step 4: Password Protection
Enable password protection for an additional security layer. Choose a strong password that you'll remember but others cannot guess. This password encrypts your wallet file on disk.

Step 5: Generate Recovery Phrase
C-Cube will generate a 12 or 24-word recovery phrase. This is crucial - write it down immediately and store it securely. This phrase can recover your entire wallet if needed.

Step 6: Verify Recovery Phrase
You'll be asked to verify your recovery phrase by selecting words in the correct order. This ensures you've recorded it accurately.

Step 7: Wallet Creation Complete
Your wallet is now created and ready to use. You'll see your wallet address, which you can use to receive cryptocurrency.

Step 8: First Steps
- Copy your receiving address
- Test with a small amount first
- Verify the transaction appears in your wallet
- Once confirmed, you can proceed with larger amounts

Remember: Never share your recovery phrase or private keys with anyone.

Your C-Cube wallet is now ready for secure cryptocurrency storage.
