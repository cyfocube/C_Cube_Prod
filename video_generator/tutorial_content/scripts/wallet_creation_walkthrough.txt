C-Cube Wallet Creation Walkthrough Script

Let's create your first C-Cube wallet step by step.

Step 1: Security Acknowledgment
When you first open C-Cube, you'll see a security acknowledgment. Read this carefully as it explains your responsibilities as a cryptocurrency user. Check the box to acknowledge that you understand the risks and responsibilities.

Step 2: Choose Network Type
Select whether you want a single-network wallet or multi-chain wallet. For beginners, we recommend starting with a single network like Ethereum or Bitcoin.

Step 3: Network Selection
Choose your specific blockchain network. Popular options include:
- Ethereum Mainnet for ETH and ERC-20 tokens
- Bitcoin for BTC transactions
- Other networks as needed

Step 4: Password Protection
Enable password protection for an additional security layer. Choose a strong password that you'll remember but others cannot guess. This password encrypts your wallet file on disk.

Step 5: Generate Recovery Phrase
C-Cube will generate a 12 or 24-word recovery phrase. This is crucial - write it down immediately and store it securely. This phrase can recover your entire wallet if needed.

Step 6: Verify Recovery Phrase
You'll be asked to verify your recovery phrase by selecting words in the correct order. This ensures you've recorded it accurately.

Step 7: Wallet Creation Complete
Your wallet is now created and ready to use. You'll see your wallet address, which you can use to receive cryptocurrency.

Step 8: First Steps
- Copy your receiving address
- Test with a small amount first
- Verify the transaction appears in your wallet
- Once confirmed, you can proceed with larger amounts

Remember: Never share your recovery phrase or private keys with anyone.

Your C-Cube wallet is now ready for secure cryptocurrency storage.
